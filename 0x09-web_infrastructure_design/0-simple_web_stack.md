The components and their roles in the web infrastructure

Server
A server is a computer or system that provides resources, services, or functionalities to other computers, known as clients, over a network. It can handle requests, process data, and deliver responses.

Domain Name
A domain name is a human-readable address that represents an IP address of a server or a group of servers. It provides a more memorable and user-friendly way to access websites instead of using IP addresses directly.

DNS Record
DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that translates domain names into IP addresses. The www record in www.foobar.com is a subdomain of the foobar.com domain and is typically used to indicate the web server associated with a website.

Web Server (Nginx)
A web server is software that handles HTTP requests from clients (such as web browsers) and delivers web pages and other files in response. Nginx is a popular web server that efficiently handles high loads and can serve static and dynamic content.

Application Server
An application server is responsible for executing application-specific logic and processing dynamic content. It interacts with the web server to handle requests, process data, and generate dynamic web pages.

Application Files (Code Base)
The application files contain the source code and other resources required to run the website's application logic. These files are executed by the application server to generate dynamic content based on user requests.

Database (MySQL)
A database is a system that stores and organizes data in a structured manner. MySQL is a widely used relational database management system (RDBMS) that can store and retrieve data efficiently.

How the components work together to serve a user requesting the website

A user wants to access the website hosted at www.foobar.com. The user's computer sends a request to the foobar.com domain.

The domain name system (DNS) resolves the domain name foobar.com to the server's IP address (e.g., 8.8.8.8) using the DNS records configured for the domain.

The user's request reaches the server at the IP address 8.8.8.8.

The web server (Nginx) running on the server receives the user's request. It handles the HTTP request and forwards it to the application server.

The application server executes the application code based on the request received. It may interact with the database (MySQL) to retrieve or store data as required.

The application server generates the dynamic content for the user's request and sends the response back to the web server.

The web server receives the response from the application server and sends it back to the user's computer.

The issues with the infrastructure:

SPOF (Single Point of Failure)
Since this infrastructure relies on a single server, it becomes a single point of failure. If the server fails, the entire website will be inaccessible. To mitigate this, a redundant and fault-tolerant setup with multiple servers can be used.

Downtime during Maintenance
When maintenance or updates are required, such as deploying new code, the web server needs to be restarted. During this downtime, the website may be inaccessible to users. To minimize downtime, techniques like load balancing or blue-green deployment can be implemented.

Limited Scalability
With only one server, this infrastructure may struggle to handle high traffic loads. If the incoming traffic exceeds the server's capacity, the website's performance may degrade, or it may become completely unresponsive.
